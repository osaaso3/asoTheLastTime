        <h4><span class="fa fa-info-circle"></span> About</h4>

        <div><span style="font-family: 'Caveat', cursive; font-size: 1.5em;">cogmod </span> is a habit tracking app that doesn't make you feel bad when you don't do something and instead helps you to stay on track:</div>

        <ul>
            <li>Instead of a streak, there is an average interval - you aren't punished for breaking a streak, you are encouraged to keep the average interval close to the desired interval.</li>
            <li>Instead of reminders, the app shows you how close to the average interval you are - there are no nagging alarms that you dismiss and forget about anyway.</li>
            <li>The app is fully customizable - you can turn any of its many features on or off.</li>
            <li>The app is completely private - it uses no cookies, nothing is sent back to the web server and it can work offline.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4><span class="fa fa-stopwatch"></span> Examples</h4>

        <p>To see what the app is capable of, you can load examples from the <span class="fa fa-fw fa-cog"></span> options menu.</p>
